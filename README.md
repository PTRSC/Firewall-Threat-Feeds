# Fortigate Threat feeds
 Threat feeds dynamically import an external block lists from an HTTP server in the form of a plain text file. Block lists can be used to enforce special security requirements, such as long term policies to always block access to certain websites, or short term requirements to block access to known compromised locations. The lists are dynamically imported, so that any changes are immediately imported by FortiOS.
